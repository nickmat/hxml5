# XHTML5 or HXML5

A project to read and write files that conform to both xml and html5 standards.

Test project using the pugixml library and extending it with a custom save function.

It is based on the W3C document [Polyglot Markup](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/) which is, sadly, no longer maintained.
